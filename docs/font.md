# font

There are multiple fonts included in the arcade-fancy-text extension for you to choose from. Please note that not every font includes every character; if you're text is failing to properly print with any font try using the "arcade default" or "arcade unicode" fonts instead.

```sig
fancyText.__fontPicker(fancyText.defaultArcade)
```

```package
arcade-fancy-text=github:riknoll/arcade-fancy-text
```
