# get color

Returns the color of the text. The color that is returned will be the color set using the `create` or `set color` apis, not any color that is set using tags.

```sig
fancyText.getColor(fancyText.create("Hello, World!"))
```

## Example #example

In this example, we print out the color of various text sprites when we overlap with them.

```blocks

```

```package
arcade-fancy-text=github:riknoll/arcade-fancy-text
```
